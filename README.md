## Thoughts 💭

## Function Components, Props, State

Even though this is unfamiliar territory, I feel like it will be easy to start blending in these elements to advance my overall understanding. If I continually reference back to my notes and MDN, I am better able to pick up on the topics that are covered.

**1. Function components** - In React, there are _two_ main types of components: function components and class components. Function components are simpler and more lightweight than class components.

**2. Props** (short for properties) are a way of _passing data_ from parent components to child components. They are like function arguments for components. You can access props inside a function component by defining them as parameters to the function.

**3. State** is similar to props, but it is _private and fully_ controlled by the component. It represents data that can change over time. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.
